# C++ Introduction - Chapter I

# CPP_Module_01

Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

## Overview

Welcome to the **C++ Introduction** module, the starting point of your journey into the world of C++ programming! This repository contains exercises and materials designed to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++.

C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, often referred to as "C with Classes" [(source: Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). This module aims to ease you into the complexities of C++ by starting with fundamental concepts and gradually introducing more advanced topics.

## Why C++?

C++ is chosen as the language for this module because:

- **Familiarity**: C++ is derived from C, a language you may already be familiar with.
- **Powerful OOP Features**: C++ is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Industry Relevance**: Understanding C++ will give you a solid foundation in programming, preparing you for other modern languages and technologies.

## C++98 Standard

This module adheres to the **C++98 standard** to keep things simple and focused on the core principles of C++. Although modern C++ has introduced many new features and improvements, starting with C++98 ensures that you grasp the fundamentals before moving on to more complex topics.

### What You Will Learn

Throughout this module, you will:

- Understand the basics of C++ syntax and structure.
- Learn key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Gain hands-on experience through progressively challenging exercises.

### Next Steps

This module is just the beginning of your C++ journey. While it covers the basics, modern C++ has evolved significantly, introducing new standards and best practices. If you aspire to become a proficient C++ developer, we encourage you to continue exploring beyond these introductory exercises, particularly focusing on newer standards like C++11, C++14, C++17, and beyond.
